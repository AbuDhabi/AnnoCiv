Automatic tile improvement
   No need to send out settlers and shit. As technology improves, and city grows, and investment in infrastructure is allocated, irrigation and mines and whatnot shows up by itself. Roads can be also made specifically with special unit types.

Limited types of units
   No warriors, legions, archers, etc. Unit types:
      - Infantry
      - Cavalry -> Armour
      - Artillery
      - Engineers
      - Battleships
      - Submarines
      - Naval Transports
      - Fighters
      - Bombers
      - Air Transports
      - Missiles?

IQ required to destroy the world
   Instead of a strict time limit, there's this. Chances are, some clever devil will figure out how to destroy the world with highly advanced technology eventually. So as IQ rises and technology improves, so does the chance that someone will destroy the planet through sheer, unthinking idiocy.

Roads -> Railroads/Highways
   Roads work like in vanilla. Railroads work twice as good. Highways work three times as good. No free transportation to wherever you want. Well, maybe with teleporters.

Technology akin to MoO and EU3
   Division into broad groups of techs, with numeric ratings. None of this specific tech tree stuff. Bonus points if we can skip certain techs, so it's impossible to get them without trading/looting. 

Design your own units
   Chassis bases define what kind of unit it is, but otherwise, go wild. At the basic level, only one unit of its type - but you get to define what kind of stuff they carry. Maybe even keeping the cavalry thing beyond invention of tanks.

Non-specific unit technologies
   I don't care if your Atrocity units use nerve gas, tactical nukes, retrovirii or gray-goo nanomachines. I do care about how much extra damage they do.

Budgeting
   Cities should work similarly to planets in MoO. Set budgets for what they produce and stuff.
      - Money: brings cash to treasury
      - Production: builds units
      - Research: puts RPs into the research pool
      - Infrastructure: improves tiles
      - Population: quickens growth

No need for specific screens
   Side and bottom bars are plenty enough for selected items such as units or cities.
